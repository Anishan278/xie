			<tr>
				<td> Siamese Cat </td>
				<td> These types of cats are very friendly with humans,<br>
				including being very affectionate and showing lots of love.<br>  
				They are also playful and energetic so you can say they have <br>
				the body of a cat but the personality of a dog! They are very good <br>
				for a family pet! </td>
				<td>Siamese cats have very light blue eyes. They have pretty long <br>
				legs along with a glossy coat. They can come in many different colors <br>
				such as blue, lilac, dark brown to black-brown or even warm to medium <br>
				brown. Sometimes their coating is darker at some places such as the paws <br>
				or ears. </td>
				<td> <img src="Images/siamese.jpg" class = "imgsize" alt = "logo" /> </td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Tabby Cat </td>
				<td> Tabby Cats are very quiet by mostly taking a nap after <br>
				being very active sometimes even for long hours. They are also <br>
				very intelligent, for example they are able to understand how <br>
				to use a litter box very quickly. These cats are indeed friendly,<br>
				many people own these felines and they’re very friendly with their owners. </td>
				<td> Tabby Cats are not actually a type of breed, it's a type of cat <br>
				that has any sort of pattern on its coat. So for example it could have<br>
				stripes, swirls, spots of different colors on its fur. Also, it’s not <br>
				really a specified color, it can be any type. However one thing that all <br>
				tabby cats share is an “M” shaped spot on their forehead regardless of <br>
				the kind of cat it is. </td>
				<td> <img src="Images/dabby.jpg" class = "imgsize" alt = "logo" /> </td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Persian Cat </td>
				<td>Persian Cats are pretty quiet cats who just like to <br> 
				lounge around. They are very affectionate and appreciate  <br> 
				attention from humans; they do not demand/require continuous  <br> 
				attention like dogs or maybe a different type of cat. However <br> 
				they are relatively calm and preserved cats. </td>
				<td>Persian Cats have a short body with short but thick legs. <br> 
				The tail and neck are also short but it has small sized ears  <br> 
				with a huge head and round eyes. Most of the common Persian <br> 
				cats are white, black or blue. </td>
				<td> <img src="Images/persiancat.jpg"  class = "imgsize" alt = "logo" /> </td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Ragdoll Cats </td>
				<td> Ragdoll Cats are usually gentle, calm and sociable and <br>
				are very affectionate without being demanding. They also love <br>
				being carried around a lot. They also require a lot of attention <br>
				and you must be with them at most times if wanting to own them. </td>
				<td> Ragdoll Cats usually have a light coloured or cream body coating.<br>
				They have short necks and are pretty muscular cats. They are also larger<br>
				than most domestic cats as they weigh about 8 - 10 pounds. </td>
                <td> <img src="Images/ragdollcat.jpg"  class = "imgsize" alt = "logo" /> </td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Norwegian Forest Cats </td>
				<td>Norwegian Forest Cats are mostly hunting <br>
				types of cats that love to get their prey, however<br>
				they also tend to have a gentle nature. Like most <br>
				cats this breed is especially independent and does <br>
				not cling onto their owners very much. Most of the <br>
				time they like to leave their home and explore around.</td>
				<td> Norwegian Forest Cats  are pretty big hunters and<br>
				are somewhat fast due to their hunter energy. They have<br>
				very long and bushy tails and have a very silky coat with <br>
				different types of patterns from the colors white, black,<br>
				blue and red.
