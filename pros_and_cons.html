	<div class = "fact1">
		<h3> <u> Does not take up lots of space for a house pet </u> <br>
		</h3> 
			<p> Cats are very independent animals and small animals, so most <br>
			of the time they roam around and a lot of the time they might <br>
			not even be in the house! This makes it so that even if you have <br>
			to get them food or make sure they have a proper sleeping area it <br>
			wouldn’t take as much space as a dog or maybe even a bird. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
			</p>
	</div>			<!--Second reason to own a cat-->
	<img src = "Images/carpetcat.png" alt = "logo" class = "image2"  /> 	
	<div class = "fact2">
		<h3> <u> Are very soft and cuddly </u> <br>
		</h3> 
			<p>Cats can offer much support by just being around. If you ever need <br>
			   to hug something or you’re feeling lonely you can just cuddle with <br>
			   a cat and most of them wouldn’t mind! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			</p>
	</div>
				<!--Third reason to own a cat-->
	<img src = "Images/cat2.jpg" class = "image3" alt = "logo" /> 	
	<div class = "fact3">
		<h3> <u> Can be a comfort animal and support you emotionally </u> 
		</h3>
			<p> Cats can often be used as support emotionally. (More on that in another page.)<br>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>

	</div>	
					<!--Fourth reason to own a cat-->
	<img src = "Images/cat3.jpg" alt = "logo" class = "image4" /> 	
	<div class = "fact4">
		<h3> <u> They are entertaining </u> </h3> 
		<p> Cats can often be used as support emotionally. (More on that in another page.)<br>
			Cats are entertaining because they love to play and they sometimes just do their <br>
			own thing. When you shine a lazer many of them try to chase after it, also they can <br>
			jump very high. Many times people buy kitty toys so that they can mess around with the <br>
			cat, however this is not needed. But sometimes just witnessing the bizarre things they <br>
			pull of is very entertaining to make your day! 
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>
	</div>
			<!--Fifth reason to own a cat-->
	<img src = "Images/cat4.jpg" alt = "logo" class = "image5" /> 	
	<div class = "fact5">
		<h3> <u> They are independant </u> </h3> 
		<p> Cats don’t really depend on their owner a lot meaning<br>
		you don’t have to fully pamper it. Of course you would need <br>
		to pay for the expenses of their necessities but they can use <br>
		the litter box on their own, eat on their own and explore a <br>
		bunch of different places.

				<!--First reason not to own a cat-->
	<img src = "Images/sleepcat.jpg" alt = "logo" class = "cimage1" /> 
	<div class = "cfact1">
		<h3> <u> They tend to scratch a lot </u> </h3> 
		<p>Cats have very sharp claws so if you were to <br>
		play with them too much or get them angry you might<br>
		end up with a huge scar. Not only can they scratch <br>
		you but they can also claw at your furniture or work <br>
		and end up getting those ruined too. So that might be<br>
		something to consider when deciding on owning a cat or <br>
		not. <br><br><br><br><br> </p>

	<div class = "cfact2">
				<!--Second reason not to own a cat-->
		<h3> <u> Can be pretty expensive to buy and take care of </u></h3> 
		<p>Most domestic animals/pets are expensive to buy and <br>
		take care of in Canada and cats are definitely not an <br>
		exception. From the cost of just being able to own them<br>
		to the money being spent on trying to provide for them,<br>
		it’s like having a whole new family member except as a pet!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>

	<div class = "cfact3">
			<!--Third reason not to own a cat-->
		<h3> <u> They shed A LOT </u> </h3>
		<p>By shedding a lot cats can leave a mess in many <br>
		people’s houses and it can be ANYWHERE. Also <br>
		something to consider is that some may experience an <br>
		allergic reaction to cat fur and it may become severe<br>
		 especially because a lot of cats are friendly with humans. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </p>

			<!--Fourth reason not to own a cat-->
		<h3> <u>Your cat may get lost</u></h3>
		<p>Like mentioned before, cats are very independent animals <br>
		and like to roam around by themselves. With this comes the <br>
		risks of losing them as they can be anywhere without you knowing, <br>
		maybe something happened to them. However, you’ll never truly know<br>
		and it can get concerning at times to know whether or no they’d <br>
		come back. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

				<!--Fifth reason not to own a cat-->
		<h3> <u> They can keep you up at night by meowing a lot </u> </h3> 
		<p>Cats can be like babies and wake you up at night.<br>
		They meow very loudly and a lot of the time they do<br>
		it constantly so you’re bound to wake up and check <br>
		out what’s going on. This can get very irritating <br>
		because you might not know how to help it yet it’d <br>
		still be continuously making noise. <br><br><br> </p>
