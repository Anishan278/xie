        </div>
		<ul>	<!--First way cats affect mental health-->
			 <li class = "texter"> Cats can allow people to sleep easier. Studies have shown that people <br>
			who have let cats sleep in their bed have had an easier time sleeping. <br>
			They also cause people to wake up fewer times during the night and experience <br>
			less fatigue. <br><br><br></li> 
							<!--Second way cats affect mental health-->
			 <li class = "texter"> Cats end up boosting peopleâ€™s self esteem. This is because having to <br>
			take care of something else other than yourself ends up giving a feeling <br>
			of fulfillment or satisfaction, and the more of that we experience, the <br>
			more confidence we end up having in ourselves. <br><br><br>
			</li> 
							<!--Third way cats affect mental health-->
			 <li class = "texter">These felines are very therapeutic as they pur. It ends up lowering stress <br>
			levels, decreases the symptoms of Dyspnoea (causes difficulties in breathing <br>
			and lessens the chance of a heart attack to occur in a person. Even if a person<br>
			worries too much, a cat purring is enough to make them stop thinking about every <br>
			little thing. <br><br><br> </li> 
							<!--Fourth way cats affect mental health-->
			<li class = "texter">Cats are also very good to have in an ergonomic environment as they do not make <br>
			much nice and just mind their own business. A lot of people who work at home tend to <br>
			have cats and they claim that it is very relaxing to be owning them.<br><br><br> </li>
